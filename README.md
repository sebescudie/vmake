vmake
=====

*Command line tool to generate VVVV project folder structure.*

Howto
----------

- Navigate to your empty vvvv project folder
- Open a `cmd` by typing `cmd` in the address bar
- Type `vmake init`
- To directly open your newly created v4p file, add `/o` command argument

```
vmake init /o
```

Folder structure
----------
This is the project structure I'm used to for my projects. Might not fit everyone's needs or habits but that's the way I roll :)

```
├── assets
|   ├─ mesh
|   ├─ sounds
|   ├─ tex
├── modules
├── subs
├── root.v4p
```
